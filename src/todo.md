- An assignee 
- Anything else that you decide

## Functional Requirements

- Framework 
    - Material UI 
- Routing 
- Sorting within a given board 
- Completed tasks 
- Navbar 
- Editing an existing task 
- Deletion of board and board item 
- Toggle display type 

## Extra
 - Add auth and the user should be able to access thire own boards 
 - Allow users to upload at least one image associated with an item.

 - Allow users to rearrange the board via drag and drop (and persist the order in the backend!). Take a look at the react-dnd library.

 ## today 
  - Changing the button from addboard to the plus btn ---- **DONE**
  - Center the board ---- **DONE**
  - board name ---- **DONE**
  - Render when we refresh  
  - delete **DONE** 
  - or edit btn **ALMOST**

   ## QUESTIONS
   - inside change.type === removed the state is empty  ?
   - when we use redux we need to double click to delete ?
   - when we pass true we get undifiend but if we pass false we get false ?
